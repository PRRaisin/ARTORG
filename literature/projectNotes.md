## Project ideas and notes

> A key aspect that is often overlooked is that expert knowl- edge about the task to be solved can provide advan- tages that go beyond adding more layers to a CNN. Groups and researchers that obtain good performance when applying deep learning algorithms often differ- entiate themselves in aspects outside of the deep net- work, like novel data preprocessing or augmentation techniques. 

* **Data augmentation**: Should we be doing this in the case of OCT?
* Attention networks: Is this an idea for our project? To identify the important blocks first?
